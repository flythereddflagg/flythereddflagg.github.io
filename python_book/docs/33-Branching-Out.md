# 33 - Branching Out

I gather by the fact you are still reading this that the past 30+ sections have failed to quench your thirst for learning about Python! Well you are in luck because I got to this point in writing and found that, although I had given a foundational understanding, most of what people use Python for is somewhat beyond the foundational. Therefore, the rest of this book will be dedicated to introducing concepts you will use in the real world! Below are some things you can do with Python. Do not feel obligated to do all of them. I have put them here to help people like me who have tried to do something new only to slog through hours and hours of tutorials and stack overflow questions to find the very specific answers to the ones they are interested in.

- [Intermediate Topics]() (COMING SOON): Want to get into some intermediate topics in Python? section should get you started on some general topics that will improve your general coding skills. This includes:
    - Data Structures: Here I will go over why Python does certain things that frustrate beginners and how to avoid pitfalls. We will get into the guts of why Python does what it does.
    - Graphical User Interfaces: Do you want to build an actual app? Like one with buttons and windows and stuff? This is a good start on using these frameworks in Python.
    - Make your own package: Want to learn how to publish your super awesome package on the Python Package Index? This section will walk you through it!

- [Science, Engineering, and Math](./E01-Getting-Started-Again.md) Included are the following subjects:
    - Conda and an introduction to interactive Python packages (Jupyter-Notebook).
    - NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, SymPy, and Pandas
    - Do advanced calculations and analysis using these packages.
    - Accessing and using databases (SQL, Excel, and webscraping)
- [Websites]() (COMING SOON): Want to make a website? Here you can make one with interactive content using Python!
- [Games]() (COMING SOON): Want to make a video game with Python? Here are some resources to get you started!
- [Hardware Interfacing]() (COMING SOON): Need to talk to a piece of equipment? Python has you covered! This introduction to Serial interfaces will walk you through how to talk to an Arduino!
