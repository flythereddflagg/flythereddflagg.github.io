## Experience

### PhD Researcher

  *Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA | Advisor: Dr. W. V. Wilding | Jul 2016 – Present*

- Research in autoignition temperatures (AIT) of pure compounds for AIChE's DIPPR 801 Database
- Improved the reliability of AIT values in the 801 Database through evaluation of data from 600+ sources
- Designed and constructed an experimental apparatus at ~ 10% of the expected capital cost 
- Increased reliability and throughput of AIT measurements by automating aspects of the experimental process
- Wrote custom software to automate data acquisition and analysis using Python and C/C++
- Brokered the release of a previously closed-source AIT prediction method for publication
- Improved the method by relaxing assumptions, improving regression data quality, and expanding applicability
- Mentored 20+ undergraduates focusing on safety and relevant laboratory skills
- Teaching assistant for undergraduate courses on "Chemical Plant Design" and "Numerical Methods"

### Engineering Intern

 *Sustainable Energy Solutions LLC, Orem, UT, USA | May 2014 – Aug 2015*

  - Worked with a team of engineers to build an experimental reactor
  - Designed and began fabrication of a novel $CO_2$​ separation process
  - Designed parts and assemblies with Autodesk Inventor CAD software
  - Personally fabricated multiple components through various welding and machining processes

### Chemical Engineering Laboratory Assistant

*Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA |  Jun 2012 – May 2014*

  - Aided development of biomass gasification kinetic models by collecting data on more than 70 reactions
  - Managed and carried out all aspects of laboratory work in an independent and unsupervised setting
  - Improved experimental efficiency by automating data analysis with Microsoft VBA
  - Trained 2 new employees in safety regulations and standard operating procedures

### Full-Time Volunteer Missionary

  *The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salta, Argentina | Sep 2009 – Sep 2011*

  - Trained and mentored 2 new missionaries
  - Conversed with 100+ people on the street and in homes explaining concepts in Spanish
  - Participated in regular community service in 5 cities. Projects included cleaning a community park, street waste disposal and hospital visits

### Biology Laboratory Assistant

  *Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA | Apr 2009 – Aug 2009*

  - Assisted a PhD candidate with experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana to find patterns in gene expression from the removal of Saccharide-9 from the plant genome
  - Collected data from over 100 specimens by making synthetic growth media, planting and observing growth patterns
