<h1 id="cli">3 - CLI</h1>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Command Line Interface (CLI)! Before we begin programming we need to understand something about the context and environment that we are working in.</p>
<p>First, we start with a little nomenclature. Perhaps you have seen a black, white or blue window with nothing but text in it on your computer. This is called the command line or the command line interface. I will refer to it as the "command line" in this lesson. An example of one is shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./media/cli.png" alt="" /><figcaption>cli</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This interface was at one point the only way to use a computer. Generally speaking, if you wanted to explore files, play a computer game or use any program, this was the way you needed to do it. There were no windowing systems or point-and-click interfaces. The way you did anything was to type commands into the prompt (seen above as the text after the <code>$</code>) and look at the output that resulted. We will be doing something similar in this lesson. To enter any command simply type the command in and press Enter.</p>
<p>Secondly, you should be familiar with basic terminology relating to file systems. (i.e. words like "folder", "file", "program" and "app"/"application"). I will use the words 'directory' and 'folder' interchangeably. All file systems I have seen start with a "root" folder (usually <code>C:\</code> for Windows and <code>/</code> for OS X and Linux). File systems start at this root folder and have a tree of sub-folders in which all files are organized. We will explore this via the command line and cover how to do basic navigation and commands. The command line is a large and powerful interface so this lesson is by no means comprehensive. It is intended to get you just competent enough to do programming. We will explore more about the command line later.</p>
<h3 id="open-the-command-line">Open the command line</h3>
<p>Depending on your operating system (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Linux) the way to open your command line differs significantly. Once your command line is open however, almost everything else is the same or very similar. I will indicate the differences where this is the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 7/8/10</strong>
<ul>
<li>From your desktop, press the windows key. (The start menu should pop up.)</li>
<li>Type in "powershell" into the start menu search bar. (A bunch of options should be displayed)</li>
<li>Select "Windows PowerShell" from the list of options to open it. (A blue box with some text and a prompt should appear that looks something like this: <code>C:\Users\"YOUR USERNAME"\&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Apple Mac OS X</strong>
<ul>
<li>Open spotlight search by pressing âŒ˜+Space. (A spotlight search bar should appear on your screen.)</li>
<li>Type "terminal" into the search bar. (Options should appear under the search bar.)</li>
<li>Select the "Terminal" application to open it. (A white box with some text should appear with a prompt that looks something like: <code>"YOUR COMPUTER'S NAME":~ "YOUR USERNAME"$</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Press <code>ctrl+t</code> or <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> from your desktop. (A bash window should appear with some text in it and a prompt that looks like: <code>"YOUR USERNAME"@"YOUR COMPUTER'S NAME" ~ $</code> or <code>-bash-4.2$</code> )</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of what kind of prompt appears on your command line interface, ignore everything on the line before the <code>$</code> or the <code>&gt;</code> that is, the prompt symbol. That part before the prompt symbol is usually irrelevant to understanding what is happening anyway. In this lesson and the rest of the book, I have omitted anything before the prompt symbol and you may interpret the <code>$</code> or the <code>&gt;</code> as being equivalent. Therefore, when you see something like <code>$ clear</code> written in the book, you should read that as, "Type the text <code>clear</code> into the command line prompt and press enter."</p>
<p>Once you have successfully opened your command line interface, you may begin the rest of the lesson. The object of this lesson is to practice and become familiar with each of the commands listed below. A summary table at the end of the lesson lists all the commands and what they do.</p>
<h3 id="where-am-i-command-pwd">Where am I? (Command: <code>pwd</code>)</h3>
<p>Begin by typing the following in your prompt and pressing Enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">pwd</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>'pwd' means 'print working directory'. This command will show you where you are in the directory structure of your computer. For example typing this command into the terminal on my linux computer will return <code>/home/mer/</code>, which tells me I am in the 'mer' directory of the 'home' directory of the root directory of my computer. Similarly in Windows, <code>pwd</code> returns <code>C:\Users\&lt;YOURNAME&gt;\</code>. Therefore if you ever get lost while navigating in the terminal, use <code>pwd</code> to figure out where you are.</p>
<h3 id="moving-around-command-cd">Moving Around (Command: <code>cd</code>)</h3>
<p>Type the following into your terminal and press Enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> ~</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>cd</code> means 'change directory' and is one of the main ways you will navigate the command line. The normal usage of the "change directory" command is of the form: <code>$ cd "NAME OF DIRECTORY"</code> (e.g. <code>cd Documents</code>) but in this case we are using the "home" short cut (<code>~</code>).</p>
<p>The tilde (<code>~</code>) is a short hand that stands for the 'home' directory. This can take you to slightly different places depending on the operating system you are running, but should be the default starting place for any folders you may wish to navigate. If you need to get back home or want to navigate from the home folder as a root folder the <code>~</code> will get you there.</p>
<p>So when you enter `` what you are telling the terminal is this: "Take me me to the home folder." Or "Change the working directory to the home folder".</p>
<h3 id="working-in-folders-commands-ls-mkdir-and-touch-or-new-item">Working in folders (Commands: <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, and <code>touch</code> or <code>New-Item</code>)</h3>
<p>Now that you are in the 'home' folder, enter the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>ls</code> is short hand for "list files and sub-folders in the current directory". Upon entering this command you should see a list of files and directories in your home folder.</p>
<p>Let's make a directory in your home folder. Enter the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> peas</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now enter the <code>ls</code> command and you will notice a new folder in your home folder called 'peas' you made it with the 'make directory' command.</p>
<p>Let's go in there!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> peas</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>$ </span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you type in the above commands in you will notice that nothing comes up! There is nothing in this folder yet so lets make a file to put in this folder! This is bit different for Windows so follow the Windows commands if you are using Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Command for Mac OS X or Linux</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">touch</span> carrots.py</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Command for Windows</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a>&gt; <span class="fu">New-Item</span> -type file carrots.<span class="fu">py</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>You have just created an empty file called <code>carrots.py</code>. The <code>.py</code> part of the filename is called the extension and is a way that a user communicates what kind of file is being used. Generally, Python files have the <code>.py</code> extension but they are not fundamentally different from plain text files (i.e. files that end in <code>.txt</code>).</p>
<p>Make another file called <code>cool_beans.txt</code> using the <code>touch</code> command (if you're on Mac OS X or Linux) or <code>New-Item</code> command (if you're on windows). Go on try it yourself!</p>
<p>Did you do it? Check that you it worked using the <code>ls</code> command. You should see that you have two files in this folder. If you're curious you can "print the working directory" and find this folder in your file explorer program on your computer. Cool huh?</p>
<p>Now that we know how to create files and folders we will now learn how to delete them.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-files-and-folders-commands-rm-rmdir">Deleting Files and Folders (Commands: <code>rm</code>, <code>rmdir</code>)</h3>
<p>Now that we know how to create files and folders we will now learn how to delete them. Let's delete your files by entering the command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">rm</span> carrots.py</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>rm</code> means "remove". Verify that this has been deleted with <code>ls</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's delete the other file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">rm</span> cool_beans.txt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you finish this your directory should once again be empty. You can verify this with <code>ls</code>.</p>
<p>Now...how do we get out of here? You may want to go directly to the home directory using</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> ~</span></code></pre></div>
<p>but you may not always want to go all the way back to the home directory when all you really want is to go to the parent directory. I will now show you the way to do this. Simply enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> ..</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a shorthand for, "change directory to the immediate parent directory" in a manner that is known as "relative path reference". In the command line, <code>.</code> or <code>./</code> is short hand for "the directory I'm in right now" and <code>..</code> or <code>../</code> means "the immediate parent folder of where I am right now".</p>
<p>You can verify that you have indeed left the <code>peas</code> directory by using the <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code> commands. Now it is time to actually delete the directory.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">rmdir</span> peas</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you didn't have any errors doing this congratulations! You have finished the basic exercises for the command line!</p>

<p>Memorize these commands or keep this cheat sheet with you to help you work in the command line. Once you feel comfortable with these commands then it's time to start programming!</p>
<h2 id="hone-your-skills">Hone your skills</h2>
<p>Here are a few questions you should research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally you have to remove every file in a directory before you can delete the directory. What is a way you can delete a directory and all its contents using one line of command line code? Why would you <em>not</em> want to do this?</li>
<li>How could you navigate to the parent directory's parent's parent directory in one line of code?</li>
<li>Look up commands to 'copy', 'rename' and 'move' files in command line. How would you complete these common tasks in command line?</li>
<li>Research other common commands in command line and learn them for your benefit. There are many good tutorials to use many powerful commands in the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-mastery">Advanced mastery</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look up 'shell scripting' for your platform (i.e. Windows Command Prompt (cmd) or Windows Powershell, Linux Bash, or OS X Terminal). Begin to learn to shell script on your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover some basics of shell scripting later of study but beginning to learn shell scripting can be powerful as many of the concepts we will learn apply to shell scripting as well.</p>
