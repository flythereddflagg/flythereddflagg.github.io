# TODO: Editing the book

- Make vocab words explicit. Have its own box. Bolded, with a formal definition that we can refer back to when we forget what that word means. 
- Scaffold the "Hone Your Skills" with example problems, 
- provide some example code to read for chapter 24, 
- provide some riddles to solve when defining functions. 
- You do this sometimes, like for the List Comprehension example, and that was gold. I loved that I had a specific resource to refer to, and a specific challenge to do according to the skill level I'm at, because I tried looking for some challenges or problems online but sometimes the answers implied that I knew some other function or method or thing that I didn't actually know yet.
