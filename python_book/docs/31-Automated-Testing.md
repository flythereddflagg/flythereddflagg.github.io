# 31 - Automated Testing

In some sense, the job of a programmer is to get a computer automatically do a task that someone else would have to do. The best programmers automate everything they can, including programming itself where possible. This section in particular will help you automate what can be one of the most necessary and evil necessary evils of programming. Testing your programs.

### Test-Driven Development

I have mentioned before that taking some time to plan your project will make the process of programming easier. One way to do this is to make programs that test whether your program performs as expected. Do this before you even write one line of code for your project. This forces you to ask important questions about your program such as: What do I want my program to actually do? How well does it have to do it? What things will cause the code to crash?

The programmer does not need to answer all these questions before beginning but it is helpful to have some basic tests ready before beginning a project. More tests can be added as the project progresses. However as you add many tests you will want to automate that part of the process as well. To do this we have a powerful tool called `nose`.

### About `nose`

At the time of writing, the original `nose` package has been replaced by `nose2` which will be maintained for the foreseeable future and has more features than the original `nose`. Therefore, this section will be an introduction on how to use `nose2` instead of `nose`.

### Install `nose`
