## Experience

### R&D Substrate Packaging Engineer

*Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA | May 2022 - Present*

- Tool and process owner for multiple acid cleaning, copper etch, and develop lithography tools
- Directed processing, troubleshooting, maintenance, and qualification work on lithography tools
- Implemented improved safety protocols and standard operating procedures for work with associated corrosive process chemistries
- Conducted experimental studies to improve process control for copper etching
- Increased yield by designing and implementing procedures for bench scale processing, which removed defects and improved consistency of processed material 
- Implemented several automations using JavaScript and Python to ensure tool health, quality and responsiveness to emergent tool issues 

### PhD Researcher

  *Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA | Advisor: Dr. W. V. Wilding | Jul 2016 – May 2022*

- Researched the autoignition temperatures (AIT) of pure compounds for AIChE's DIPPR 801 Database
- Improved the reliability of AIT values in the 801 Database through evaluating data from 600+ sources 
- Filled gaps in the 801 Database by measuring AIT for 20 pure compounds
- Designed and constructed an experimental apparatus at ~ 10% of the expected capital cost 
- Increased reliability and throughput of AIT measurements by automating aspects of the experimental process
- Wrote custom software to automate data acquisition and analysis using Python and C/C++
- Brokered the release of a previously closed-source AIT prediction method for publication
- Improved the method by relaxing assumptions, improving regression data quality, and expanding applicability
- Mentored 20+ undergraduates focusing on safety and relevant laboratory skills
- Teaching assistant for undergraduate courses on "Chemical Plant Design" (3 times)  and "Numerical Methods"

### Engineering Intern

 *Sustainable Energy Solutions LLC, Orem, UT, USA | May 2014 – Aug 2015*

  - Worked with a team of engineers to build an experimental, multi-fuel, combustion reactor
  - Designed and began fabrication of a novel $CO_2$​ separation process
  - Designed parts and assemblies with Autodesk Inventor CAD software
  - Personally fabricated multiple components through various welding and machining processes

### Chemical Engineering Laboratory Assistant

*Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA |  Jun 2012 – May 2014*

  - Aided development of biomass gasification kinetic models by collecting data on more than 70 reactions
  - Managed and carried out all aspects of laboratory work in an independent and unsupervised setting
  - Improved experimental efficiency by automating data analysis with Microsoft VBA
  - Trained 2 new employees in safety regulations and standard operating procedures

### Full-time Volunteer Missionary

*The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salta, Argentina | Sep 2009 – Sep 2011*

- Taught gospel topics and personally interacted with 100+ individuals on a daily basis
- Organized and participated in community service events
- Trained 2 new missionaries
