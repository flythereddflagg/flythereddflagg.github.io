\emph{Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA \textbar{} Advisor:
Dr.~W. V. Wilding \textbar{} Jul 2016 -- Present}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Researched the autoignition temperatures (AIT) of pure compounds for
  AIChE's DIPPR 801 Database
\item
  Improved the reliability of AIT values in the 801 Database through
  evaluating data from 600+ sources
\item
  Filled gaps in the 801 Database by measuring AIT for 13 pure compounds
\item
  Designed and constructed an experimental apparatus at
  \textasciitilde{} 10\% of the expected capital cost
\item
  Increased reliability and throughput of AIT measurements by automating
  aspects of the experimental process
\item
  Wrote custom software to automate data acquisition and analysis using
  Python and C/C++
\item
  Brokered the release of a previously closed-source AIT prediction
  method for publication
\item
  Improved the method by relaxing assumptions, improving regression data
  quality, and expanding applicability
\item
  Mentored 20+ undergraduates focusing on safety and relevant laboratory
  skills
\item
  Teaching assistant for undergraduate courses on ``Chemical Plant
  Design'' (3 times) and ``Numerical Methods''
\end{itemize}
