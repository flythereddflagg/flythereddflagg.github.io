There are many things missing and there may be bugs and other issues. Part of the reason to play test this early is to find these issues and rectify them.</li> <li>That should be no reason to hold back on any criticism you may have. I hold that any and all criticism will only serve to make me examine what is good and bad about this game.</li> <li>Because this is an MVP, however, I have included the controls for this game and also a few notes on starting the game. Please email me with any questions or concerns.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks again and I hope you enjoy!</p> <p>Sincerely,Mark FlyTheReddFlagg Games</p>"},{"location":"#running-the-game","title":"Running the game","text":"<ol> <li>After following the GitHub link, you will see a list of boxes with different versions with names like \"v0.1.4-alpha\". </li> <li>The box at the top should be the newest version.
