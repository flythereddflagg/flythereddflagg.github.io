# Thank You for your interest in play testing Red Castle Avenger!

Latest release: v0.2.1 (Released Thu Apr 3, 2025 at 9:00 pm)

### Dear Player,

I have put together this feedback system to help **Red Castle Avenger** (RCA) be the best I can make it. You are a critical part of that process. If you thought this was the best game you have ever played (unlikely...) I want to hear about it. If you thought this was hot steaming garbage, I ALSO want to hear about it!

### The ask from you is as follows:

1. Download and unzip the latest version of the game from [This GitHub Link](https://github.com/flythereddflagg/RCA/releases) (If you use Windows, make sure you download the zip file with "windows" in the filename.)
2. Please make at least one good faith attempt to open, play, and enjoy the game (or play as many times as you want!)
3. After you are done play testing Red Castle Avenger please submit your feedback on this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSderlCWcMT3Gautv6mrwIdU-W572MYuIz5tmgwpKpN1ikAwwA/viewform?usp=dialog) or you may also email me ([redddogjr@gmail.com](mailto:redddogjr@gmail.com?subject=RCA%20Feedback&body=What%20did%20you%20think%20of%20RCA?)) your thoughts if you prefer.

You may play multiple times and submit multiple feedback forms if you want. As the asker of this feedback, I am beholden to you for whatever feedback you give. My sincere hope is that I can use whatever feedback you give to make the game better and more enjoyable.

### With that said, here are a few notes on the game

- The game at this point is a minimum viable product (MVP), which is to say that it is the absolute bare minimum to be called a game. There are many things missing and there may be bugs and other issues. Part of the reason to play test this early is to find these issues and rectify them.
- That should be no reason to hold back on any criticism you may have. I hold that any and all criticism will only serve to make me examine what is good and bad about this game.
- Because this is an MVP, however, I have included the controls for this game and also a few notes on starting the game. Please email me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks again and I hope you enjoy!

**Sincerely,<br>Mark **<br>![FlyTheReddFlagg Games Icon](assets/flythereddflagggames_icon.png)<br>**FlyTheReddFlagg Games**

## Running the game

1. After following the [GitHub link](https://github.com/flythereddflagg/RCA/releases), you will see a list of boxes with different versions with names like "v0.1.4-alpha". 
2. The box at the top should be the newest version. Scroll down until you see the "Assets" drop down and select it: It should show download links to a few different zip files and the source code. 
3. Select the zip file with your operating system in it (e.g. "RCA_v0.1.4-**windows**-amd64-3.12.zip") and the download should begin. 
4. You can unzip the downloaded zip file by selecting and right clicking on the file and selecting "extract all" from the pop up menu. 
5. Once the files are unzipped you should see a list of files and folders. Look for the executable file called "RCA.exe" or something similar and double click it. 
6. The game should start running! If you run into problems, feel free to email me ([redddogjr@gmail.com](mailto:redddogjr@gmail.com?subject=RCA%20Feedback&body=What%20did%20you%20think%20of%20RCA?)) for help.
