# E1 - Getting Started Again

<!--How much math should they know?-->

The sections of this book that start with an E indicate that this is a tutorial related to science and engineering. In these sections I assume you know a lot more math. Here we will cover some common tools you will need to succeed in the STEM space. WIthout further ado, lets get started!

## Conda

First things first, I am going to have you uninstall Python. 

"What?" you say in disbelief. Don't worry, we will replace it with something better. Or rather, we will replace it with Python but a different distribution of Python called Anaconda.

### What is Anaconda?

Anaconda is a tool for doing scientific programming in a convenient way using Python. Think of it as Python with some extra bells and whistles. If you go to the [Anaconda Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and get it right now you will download Python bundled with hundreds of other libraries used in for various STEM applications. However, **I am going to recommend you do something different**. Instead of downloading half the internet when you only need a few libraries here and there, I recommend you get [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links), which is Anaconda without hundreds of bundled packages. Instead of all those you get one extremely useful tool: conda.

### What is conda?

Conda is what `pip` wishes it could be.
